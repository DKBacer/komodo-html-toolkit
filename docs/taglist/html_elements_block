# List complete for HTML 4 and (planned) HTML 5 elements
# List updated: 2009-04-18

# htmlUtils.js updated accordingly: 2009-04-18
# tag names followed by a double * were NOT included in htmlUtils.js for the
# following reason: these elements are rarely indented by users, who often
# prefer to write <p>Content</p> over <p>\n Content \n</p>

# Note that the concept of "block-level element" mentionned in the HTML 4 spec
# is a pedagogic simplification, rather than a strict rule. The default value
# of the CSS "display" property is not a reliable criterium either. So insted
# this list is based on a question, namely: "Do people tend to put a lot of
# content or indent the content of this element?" If yes, the element is
# included in the list.
