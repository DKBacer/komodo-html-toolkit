=====

The html_elements_* files in this folder list HTML elements, writtend in
lowercase.

html_elements_all
-----------------

A comprehensive list of HTML elements. This list covers:

- All 91 valid HTML 4.01 elements (whether deprecated or not).
- Elements listed in the HTML 5 Working Draft (as of April 2009)
- Elements that are not part of HTML 4.01 or HTML 5, but are still widely used.

html_elements_empty
-------------------

Based on the html_elements_all list. This one only lists the elements whose
content model is "EMPTY". Typically, such elements should be outputted as
<tagname> (HTML syntax) or <tagname /> (XHTML syntax).

html_elements_block
-------------------

Based on the html_elements_all list. This one only lists the elements which can
be considered "block-level" (notion defined in HTML 4.01).

This list is used to check an autocomplete pattern against, and to decide
whether it should be treated as a "normal" tag or as a "block" tag. A block
tag will be outputted, by default, like this:

<tagname>
	[[%tabstop]]
</tagname>

Options could let the user opt for this pattern:

<tagname>
[[%tabstop]]
</tagname>

Or a neutral pattern (as with "normal" tags):

<tagname>[[%tabstop]]</tagname>
